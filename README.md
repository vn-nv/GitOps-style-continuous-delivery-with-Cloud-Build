# GitOps-style-continuous-delivery-with-Cloud-Build
The project creates a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds a container image from committed code, stores the image in Artifact Registry, updates a Kubernetes manifest in a Git repository, and deploys the application to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using that manifest.
